# Single end reads?

In the current implementation, **proatac** only supports paired-end reads. There's
some support on [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/p/215988/) that explains
what one should do given single-end sequencing data. 

# I found a bug / error; what do I do? 

Please let us know if you find any errors/inconsistencies in the documentation or code
by filing a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/buenrostrolab/proatac/issues).

# I ran proatac; now what do I do? 

A non-exhaustive list of ideas / resources includes:

- Perform nucleosome calling with [NucleoATAC](http://nucleoatac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Identify variable transcription factors using [chromVAR](https://github.com/GreenleafLab/chromVAR)
- Compare peaks called from **proatac** to existing datasets. [CistromeDB](http://www.cistrome.org/db/#/)
is a particularly useful resource for this.
